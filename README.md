Website: https://menabebawy1.github.io/Biology-Website/

I created this website for my AP Biology class. It was created for anyone who was interested in the class and wanted to know more about it. They would simply go to the website and see the themes and get a good idea of what they would be studying. I was going for a clean, minimal, and professional look.

The website includes the main themes of the class and points that go into details about those themes.

The following is a little preview:
